# Personal website
This is the repository of my personal website, which can be accessed via https://reemify.dev

This website was created with a super vanilla stack, not even Sass is used. I wanted to lessen the load and not have to update any package versions whenever I wanted to code, while also coding from a holistic approach rather than an expansive one. 
Think of this as an indie-web project for myself. Learn more about indie-web here: https://indieweb.org/

Much of this was heavily inspired by my dear friend and ex-colleague Maureen Holland. She talks about her own journey of indie-webbing and vanilla stacks on her Magpie blog: https://maureenholland.ca/magpie/
